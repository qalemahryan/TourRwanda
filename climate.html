        ... with neighboring Tanzania in the east stretches the "East-Rwandan dry and hot lowland zone", a savanna climate which can be regarded as an extension of the Iwemberre steppe which lies to the east. Rising gradually from east to west, this zone tops out at elevations of about 1600 m.a.s.l. The annual average temperature rea- ches 21˚C in this lowland zone while the mean annual rainfall reaches 899 mm (Figure 2). Due to the enormous extent of the East Rwandan lowlands, however, certain locales along the border with Tanzania diverge markedly from the annual averages. Drier expanses in the east ex- hibit localized rainfall amounts of <800 mm, in contrast to rainfall that can reach >1000 mm in higher-situated areas of the lowland zones. Within the dry zone, south- east of Kigali, lies the "humidity island" of Kibungo. This area with rainfall that increases to just over 1000 mm contrasts with precipitation amounts in the 800 mm range. Where the annual rainfall is evenly distributed ranging between 900 and 1000 mm, agriculture can be practiced. The adequate water supply and temperatures favor the cultivation of moisture-loving crops like cas- sava and sweet potatoes, even cotton in some places. Next comes the "Temperate zone of the central highlands (Figure 2), whose elevations increase from east to west, connecting to the "East-Rwandan dry and hot lowland zone", rainfall also increases markedly along with eleva- tion with an annual temperatures average 19˚C, rainfall at 1200 mm is distinctly higher than in the eastern terri- tories. The highlands remain free of frost up to 2500 m.a.s.l. Notably, the temperate zone's yearly temperature swings are less pronounced than those in the eastern lowlands. For that reason, the temperate highlands zone can be termed Rwanda's most extraordinarily fertile ag- Figure 2.

Although the population density in this region is not Rwanda's highest, it does exhibit consistently high numbers spread over the individual administrative units (e.g. Rutsiru and Rubavu, each with 500 -1000 inh·km -2 or Ruhango and Huye with 500 inh·km -2 , [12]). The per- manent crops in the Central Highlands are bananas and coffee. Cultivation is possible up to 2000 m.a.s.l. Based on location and altitude above sea level, a third localized climate zone can be distinguished from the rest of the country: In the south there is the mountain range of the Congo-Nile watershed ("Crête Congo-Nil"); the volcanic chain of the Virungas in the north (Figure 1). These ar- eas can be described as Rwanda's "Mountain climate", with rainfall of >1600 mm and temperatures that only reach 16˚C (Figure 2). At about 2500 m.a.s.l. is Rwanda's cultivation limit. The Lake Kivu Rift Valley demarcates the fourth of Rwanda's local climate zones (Figure 2). The land-lake-wind circulation interacts with the high evaporation rates prevailing on Lake Kivu to create a distinct regional climate system. Due to the circulation, sufficient amounts of rain fall on the western slopes of the Congo-Nile watershed mountain range. This works to the local's climatic advantage, since it is actually in the lee of the Virunga volcano chain. Year-round tempera- tures that hover around 20˚C endow the Lake Kivu re- gion with a favorable climate. The Bugarama Rift Coun- try abuts south of Lake Kivu. It is the southern part of the Rift Valley on Rwandan territory and here is also Rwan- da's lowest point at 900 m.a.s.l. (Figure 1). With an av- erage of 24˚C and rainfall of about 1200 mm, it is also the country's least favored ...

          ... East Rwandan high plains ("Plateau orientale") covers the area between the middle section of the Akag- era River and the south to north flowing Akanyaru Ri- ver's course. The Akagera system's drainage area shapes the morphology of this area. The Akagera in particular and its tributaries have cut deeply into the landscape. The valley bottoms for the most part are marshy (Figure 1). The Central Highlands ("Plateau central") are a crystal- line mountainous area [1]. In the east, they abut the East Rwandan high plains. The "Plateau central" is marked by the east-facing rim of the Central African Rift Valley, which, starting from 1800 meters (at the border with Burundi) rises to almost 3000 m.a.s.l. Profoundly weath- ered gneisses and granites cover a large area. Aided by the steep gradient, smaller streams flowing out of the mountain ranges have left surface areas severely frag- mented. The high relief intensity, especially marked here in the Central Highlands, has helped Rwanda earn the sobriquet "Land of a thousand hills" ("pays aux milles collines"). Eventually, the edge of the trench drops down about 1000 meters into the Central African Rift Valley where they join up in the west [1]. Lake Kivu had been dammed up by volcanic lava flows, later filling a large portion of the roughly 40 km-wide Rift zone. The lake's surface lies at 1460 m.a.s.l. The Ruizi River forms the border with Democratic Republic of Congo. Since it burst through a volcanogenic blockage, it flows toward Lake Tanganyika, which sits at an elevation of only 773 meters. In the northwest, the Virunga volcanic chain runs along the border with Uganda and the Democratic Re- public of Congo. The volcanoes sit on top of a system of fissures in an area alongside the Central African Rift [3] (Figure 1). This range of volcanoes with its several peaks rose up during the Tertiary and has remained active to the present day. All but one of the Virungas (Sabinyo) are cone-shaped volcanoes, characterized by eruptions of the Strombolian type. The massif's peaks range between 3500 and 4500 meters in elevation. In its middle sits Karisimbi, at 4507 meters Rwanda's highest mountain, also named "the white shell" for the snow that occasion- ally covers its peak. South of the Virungas, between 1400 and 2200 m.a.s.l., stretches a vast lava ...
